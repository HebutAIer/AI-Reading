# Introduction

* **AI Problem**
    > * In the early days of artificial intelligence: Problem that can be described by a list of formal, mathenatical rules. 
    > * The true challenge to artificial intellignece: Problem that easy for people to perform but hard for people to describe formally.
* **Knowledge base**: seek to hard-code knowledge about the world in formal languages
    > * None of these projects has led to a major success.
* **Machine learning**: enable computers to tackle problems involving knowledge of the read world and make decisions that appear subjective.
    > * The performance of these simple machine learning algorithms depends heavily on the representation of the data.
    > * Model can learn how each of sample's features correlates with its labels, but cannot influence how features are defined in any way
* **Representation learning**: use machine learning to discover not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself. 
    > * Result in much better performance that can be obtained with hand-designed minimal human intervention.
    > * Enable AI systems to rapidly adapt to new tasks, with minimal human intervention.
* **Deep learning**: allowing computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined through its relation to simpler concepts.
